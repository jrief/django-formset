    Wrap a ModelForm into a FormCollection
    --------------------------------------

    Here we wrap an existing form, which inherits from `django.forms.models.ModelForm` class into a
    FormCollection. Apart from adding an extra nesting level in the submitted data, this does not
    have any side effects.

    Using this might be useful if you want to add a legend on top â€“, or a help text on the bottom
    of the rendered form, something which is only possible with collections.

            help_text = "Selected options on the right hand side can be sorted by dragging"
